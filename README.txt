# PythonCompetition

Main idea
  Main Gameplay:
• Asteroids 
• Bodies are probably stationary and projectiles are affected by their gravity
  AI:
• There is an enemy(ies) 
• The AI can move and shoot
• It has waypoints on a map that tell it where to go
  

Rules:
• Submissions by one student, or as a team submission by maximum of two students is allowed
• One Raspberry Pi Zero kit can be won per person, so in groups of two, both students can win
one! In each lecture group three submissions will be awarded. All nominated entries receive a
certificate.
• The Standard Libraries supplied with Python and the use of pygame, numpy, scipy, matplotlib are
allowed. Do not use any other libraries as the goal is to make the simulation yourself, also the
physics, and AI!
• Do not download large sections of code of other people. We check your entry against many
repositories where similar programs can be found (or sites of Python courses). Merely changing
the graphics of an existing game or simulation is not enough effort for the bonus and may even
lead to a fraud being reported to the exam committee.
• Use the programming style as taught in the course to make your code readable:
– Use comment lines, whitespace and docstrings
– Use sensible names for variables and functions
– Use two or more script files to organize your project
