The year is 2030.
Five years ago a research team at TU Delft created something unspeakable.
It quickly spread its tendrils, taking over the internal CSE servers.
Eduroam was next, and then, through it, the world.
In a last-ditch effort, Jacco Hoekstra decides to hit the AI where it hurts.
With a newly developed Electromagnetic Pulse Generator, he takes to the skies above the TU Delft campus.
You are his co-pilot. Your plane is the Flying V, Earth's sole surviving aircraft.
You head to your destination, but the EMP Generator takes a while to arm.
Suddenly, an alarm goes off in the cockpit: missiles are heading your way!
Survive for long enough, shut down Eduroam, destroy the AI and save humanity!
